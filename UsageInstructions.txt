SMAKE Usage Instructions

To Build:
    - type "make" with Makefile, all c files, and all h files in current directory.

To Run:
    - type "./smake" to build from Smakefile in your current working directory.
    - Will build from first rule in Smakefile by default
    - Optionally takes one command-line argument, which is to be the name of the target
    of a rule to start building from.

Smakefile format:
    - Any line that does not begin with a '\t' character will be interpreted as a target and dependencies line.
    - Any line that does begin with a '\t' character will be interpreted as a line of actions corresponding to the nearest
    target above in the file.
    - Spaces between dependencies distinguish them from each other.
    - Any other white space before a target, around the separator ':', between dependencies, or between rules
    is disregarded (besides new lines).
    - If the first non-white space line begins with a '\t' character, smake will throw an error as there is non
    target to correspond with those actions.

Will Not Handle:
    - variables
    - circular dependencies
    - multiple targets for a single rule.

Notes:
    - Hash table implementation seemed to work reasonably well. It was likely more complicated than a tree 
    implementation, which was shown as it seemed to increase my code complexity.
